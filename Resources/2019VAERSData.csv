The patient's historical condition included mild, intermittent asthma and was otherwise healthy. On an unspecified date, the patient was administered INN Flu Vaccine Seasonal [dose, route of administration, anatomical location, batch number, expiry date, trade name and manufacturer: not reported] for an unknown indication. On an unspecified date after vaccination (reported as 5 months ago), the patient developed high fever and right-sided chest pain of 2 days duration. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized. Upon admission, his body temperature was 103.7-degree F, heart rate was 160/minute, respiratory rate was 32 per minute, blood pressure was 95/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation was 95 percent on room air. The patient was alert, interactive, in moderate respiratory distress with subcostal retractions and no air entry on the right side. Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for influenza B (explicitly coded as vaccination failure). Chest X-ray showed right lower lobe pneumonia with pleural effusion and a normal-sized cardiac silhouette. He was placed on high-flow nasal cannula, and intravenous ceftriaxone and oral oseltamivir were initiated. A right pleural pigtail catheter was inserted and drained 130 ml of serosanguineous fluid. CT scan showed a moderate to large loculated right-sided pleural effusion with complete consolidation of the right lung. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with pleural decortication and adhesiolysis. Pleural fluid culture grew methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and vancomycin and rifampin were added to the antibiotic regimen. Clinical improvement did not occur as expected after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, with persistence of high-grade fevers and general malaise. He developed generalised oedema, diffuse abdominal pain, and feeding intolerance. Plain X-ray of the abdomen showed multiple dilated loops of small bowel suggestive of subacute obstruction. Abdominal ultrasound revealed small amount of ascites and oedema surrounding the gall bladder. Persistent tachycardia and increase in respiratory distress warranted escalation of non-invasive respiratory support. A chest X-ray on day 6 of hospitalisation showed enlarged cardiac silhouette, and echocardiogram showed a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with stranding. Interventricular bounce was present, suggesting haemodynamically significant effects on diastolic function. Pericardial window surgery with drainage of effusion yielded 250 ml of yellow, cloudy fluid. The pericardial fluid did not grow any organism in culture. Multiple blood cultures were also negative. There was significant clinical improvement, and the patient was discharged home after receiving 4 weeks of intravenous vancomycin and rifampin. The patient was doing well on follow-up. The outcome was recovered. The reporter assessed the case as serious (hospitalization). Reporter's Comments: A 4-year-old male patient was diagnosed with influenza B infection (considered as vaccination failure), community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus co-infection, purulent pericarditis, right lower lobe pneumonia, empyema, pericardial effusion, ascites, small bowel obstruction, gallbladder edema, generalised edema and diastolic dysfunction, 5 months after receipt of INN flu vaccine seasonal. The diagnoses were supported by abnormal investigations which included influenza B test positive, chest X ray, CT scan of chest, ultrasound abdomen, pleural fluid culture positive and ECG. Considering the fact that influenza vaccines do not have 100% effectiveness and a protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients, the event influenza and vaccination failure assessed as related to suspect vaccine. The event purulent pericarditis and empyema (proven methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection) are infective in origin, hence the role of inactivated suspect vaccine is ruled out. The events right lower lobe pneumonia, pericardial effusion, ascites, generalised edema, gallbladder edema and diastolic dysfunction are the complications of underlying events empyema and purulent pericarditis. Hence, assessed as not related to suspect vaccine. The event small bowel obstruction, assessed as not related considering biological implausibility with the suspect vaccine and multiple underlying events are considered as confounding factors. The company assessed the events influenza B virus infection, vaccination failure, purulent pericarditis, pneumonia lobar, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, bowel obstruction, gallbladder oedema, pericardial effusion and ascites as serious (medically significant).",,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,Test Name: Multiple blood culture; Test Result: Negative; Test Name: Blood pressure; Test Name: Body temperature; Test Result: 103.7 {DF}; Test Name: Pericardial fluid did not grow any organism in culture; Test Result: Negative; Test Name: Heart rate; Test Result: 160 {DF}; Test Name: Nasopharyngeal swab was positive for Influenza B; Test Result: Positive; Test Name: Oxygen saturation; Test Result: 95 %; Test Name: Respiratory rate; Test Result: 32 {DF},UNK,,,,Medical History/Concurrent Conditions: Asthma,,USSEQIRUS201806218,2,01/01/2019,,,,

The patient's concomitant medications included Metformin, Simvastatin, Omeprazole, Amlodipine, Doxazosin and Levothyroxine for unknown indications. On 21-Dec-2018, the patient was administered INN Flu vaccine seasonal [influenza vaccine, influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, route of administration: intramuscular, anatomical location: deltoid, dose, batch number, expiry date, manufacturer and trade name: not reported] for influenza prophylaxis. On the same day, after vaccination, the patient developed metallic taste and vision changes which the patient felt that the areas of letters were missing and he couldn't read at all.

The reporter assessed this case as non-serious.; Reporter's Comments: A 73-year-old, elderly male patient with medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure developed metallic taste and vision changes with reading disorder, on the same day after INN Flu vaccine. Considering the plausible temporal relationship between vaccination and events (metallic taste and vision changes) the company assessed the events as possibly related to suspect vaccine. However, the co-administered metformin should be considered as confounding factor for the event of metallic taste. Despite temporal association between vaccination and event of reading disorder, the clinical course suggests the reported vision changes as a more plausible explanation for the event. Hence, the company assessed the causality as not related to suspect vaccine.

The patient was vaccinated with hepatitis A vaccine (manufacturer and batch number: not reported) along with varicella vaccine (other manufacturer, batch number: not reported) on an unknown date. Within 30 minutes to less than 60 minutes after vaccination the patient experienced angioedema, lips swelling, throat closure, red itchy eyes, cough, erythema, rash and vomiting. The patient was sent to the clinic. The emergency department doctor attributed vaccines as trigger for the events (vaccine triggered anaphylaxis). The patient was treated with epinephrine, oral antihistamine, oral H2 blocker, parenteral steroid, intravitreal injection (IVT) and bronchodilator. The patient was referred to an allergist. Final outcome of the events was reported as complete recovery. Seriousness of the events was not reported, but the event anaphylactic reaction was upgraded as medically significant based on Novartis Important Medical Events (NVS-IME) list. The author described the case as Brighton Level 1 of diagnostic certainty. The author concluded that the present study was based on a very large population receiving currently used vaccines and confirmed the rarity of post-vaccination anaphylaxis overall and after specific vaccines. Although anaphylaxis after immunization was rare; its immediate onset (usually within minutes) and life-threatening nature require that all personnel and facilities providing vaccinations have procedures in place for anaphylaxis management. Additional provider education concerning current recommendations for treatment and follow-up appears to be warranted. Upon review following corrections were done: Medical history of the patient was of allergies and anaphylaxis but the hypersensitivity to any particular product or its excipient was not reported.

She was notably flushed, tachypneic, satting 88% on room air, lungs clear, tachycardic with regular rhythm. I requested my attending physician Dr. to assist me with management at this point. She stated she had to go to the bathroom, as she was having acute-onset diarrhea. She was helped to the restroom by MA and had profuse diarrhea, she subsequently felt too weak to get off the toilet, and was then assisted to the floor. While patient was helped to the bathroom, EMS was called for concerns for anaphylactic shock. Dr. and Dr. accompanied the patient in the bathroom. Vitals were re-obtained which showed BP 70/40s with weak distal extremity pulses.

EMS arrived, and she was still alert and able to answer questions, though with slowed mentation and complaining of diffuse abdominal pain. Given concern for anaphylactic shock, she was emergently transported to the ED by paramedics. At Hospital ED, she received a dose of 10 mg dexamethasone IV and famotidine 40 mg IV, though vital signs were stable upon arrival. She was prescribed an epipen at the time of discharge from the ED. She was diagnosed with anaphylaxis and discharged home in stable condition. She returned to our clinic 12/31/18 for follow-up, and was notably in stable condition. She was referred to an allergist for formal testing, though it is presumed her anaphylaxis was likely secondary to either the PNEUMOVAX vaccine (which she received first) or the flu vaccine (which she received second). I suspect the reaction was more likely secondary to the PNEUMOVAX vaccine, as her symptoms of feeling short of breath started just prior to her receiving the flu vaccine, and she has received the flu vaccine 4 years ago with no adverse effects.",,,Y,,,,,,Y,12/19/2018,12/19/2018,0,none,PVT,,OTC probiotics daily; Albuterol sulfate HFA PRN,Mild intermittent asthma; Chronic diarrhea,Mild intermittent asthma; Chronic diarrhea,,,2,01/02/2019,,Y,Y,Vicodin (nausea); Pet dandruff (rash)

Patient is a twin male born at 36w6d without any complications and did not require a NICU stay. Was developing normally and has not had any recent illness, fevers or trauma. He was in the care of his nanny that has been present for approximately 3-4 weeks he began having right arm twitching which turned into a generalized seizure and he fell down and nanny caught him. He continued to have a seizure for approximately 15 minutes while he was transported to the emergency department he did receive 1.3 mg of IM VERSED. In the emergency department he had a second seizure and received 1.7 mg of VERSED and he was intubated using 3mm ETT and rocuronium. Afterwards he was loaded with KEPPRA at 30mg/kg. Head CT was negative on the way to the ICU. UA negative. UCx and BCx were collected and pt given to ROCEPHIN. In the ICU, patient was continued on a VERSED drip. He appeared stable. He did have episodes of myoclonus. vEEG was obtained. I conducted a lumbar puncture. Prior to LP, patient had an episode of myoclonus followed by tonic clonic activity for which he received aditional VERSED. Discussed the results with neurology. His myoclonus is not seizure activity however tonic clonic activity was a seizure. He continued to have a foci of activity that was central and it was recommended he receive 20mg/kg of phenobarbital."" Upon admission patient was initially transferred to the PICU. Pediatric Neurology was consulted who recommended an EEG and MRI Brain. The patient was placed on continuous vEEG and initially kept on a versed drip while intubated pending completion of MRI. MRI was completed without difficulty and resulted as normal; vEEG was completed while on VERSED drip and found to be abnormal. Findings were suggestive of focal neuronal dysfunction of the bitemporoparietal regions with an underlying mild-moderate, nonspecific encephalopathy, therefore per recommendations the patient was started on maintenance KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID. Patient was without recurrent encephalopathy or return of seizures therefore was extubated later that evening on 02/10. Patient was extubated following the MRI, unfortunately he had significant stridor, increased work of breathing, and hypoxemia following extubation which did not improve after Racemic Epi, DECADRON, or High Flow Nasal Cannula therefore the patient was reintubated. He remained stable and was continued on DECADRON, he was again extubated on 02/12 without any further difficulty or respiratory distress. Infectious disease work-up continued to be reassuring including blood, urine, and CSF cultures with no growth to date as well as negative HSV and Enterovirus CSF PCR's. Patient was transferred to the floor where he remained stable with no further seizure activity. On day of discharge, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable on RA and tolerating PO with adequate urine output. He had no seizures further seizures, antiepileptic therapy of KEPPRA 20mg/kg BID that was initiated.

794540,01/04/2019,,47.0,,,F,,"This is a serious literature case, initially received on 24-Dec-2018, concerning a 47-year-old, adult, female patient. The patient's current conditions included Raynaud's phenomenon, Barrett's oesophagus and herpes labialis. The patient's concomitant medications included ergocalciferol, omeprazole and valacyclovir for unknown indications. The patient denied use of over-the-counter flu medications or decongestants. On an unspecified date, the patient was administered FLUVIRIN (2016-2017 formula) (dose: 0.5 ml, route of administration; intramuscular, anatomical location, batch number and expiry date: not reported) for an unknown indication. On an unspecified date, nine days after vaccination, the patient developed a greyish central spot in her right eye. On examination, the patient's best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/20 Snellen in both eyes. The anterior segment exam was unremarkable in either eyes. Fundus examination of her right eye revealed a few intraretinal blot haemorrhages along with pigment mottling and few drusen in the macula. The left eye was unremarkable except for a few macular drusen. A 24-2 Humphrey visual field (HVF) demonstrated a right supratemporal paracentral scotoma. On unspecified dates, chest X-ray and initial laboratory work-up including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipids and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were normal. Hyperviscosity and hypercoagulability studies including protein electrophoresis, homocysteine, protein C/S, Factor V Leiden, and serum viscosity were also unremarkable. Inflammatory markers [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), anticardiolipin antibody, antiphospholipid III antibody, C and P anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)] were within normal limits. Testing for syphilis [rapid plasma reagin test (RPR)], Bartonella, tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. On an unspecified date, the patient underwent fluorescein angiogram which demonstrated normal transit times and changes consistent with mild vasculitis with late optic nerve staining and peripheral perivascular leakage in the right eye. Indocyanine green angiography and B-scan ultrasonography were normal. On an unspecified date, the patient underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), 4 days after the onset of symptoms, which showed diffuse hyper-reflectivity of the outer plexiform layer (OPL), Henle's layer and the outer nuclear layer (ONL) at and nasal to the fovea. Near-infrared imaging of the right eye on presentation showed a well demarcated wedge-shaped hypo-reflective macular lesion involving the fovea. SD-OCT through the affected area revealed thinning of the ONL and disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) and interdigitation zone (IZ). The findings of early hyper-reflectivity of the OPL and ONL followed later by thinning of the ONL and disruption of the EZ/IZ are consistent with acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN). On an unspecified date, the patient underwent projection resolved -optical coherence tomography angiography (PR-OCTA). PR-OCTA B-scans with flow overlay through the AMN lesion demonstrated attenuation of flow signal at the level of the deep capillary plexus (DCP), which is located at the junction between the inner nuclear layer and the OPL. On an unspecified date, at her 3-week follow-up, BCVA remained 20/20 Snellen in both eyes but she continued to complain of a right paracentral scotoma. Fundus examination showed near resolution of the few scattered intraretinal blot haemorrhages and repeat SD-OCT demonstrated similar thinning of the ONL but with some restoration of the EZ/IZ. OCTA B-scans, as well as PR-OCTA, revealed persistent decrease but relatively improved flow signal in the DCP compared to the initial scan suggesting partial reperfusion of the DCP (recovering). At the time of this report, the patient was recovering from the event. The reporter assessed the causality of the event AMN as related to the suspect vaccine (as extensive laboratory testing excluded other infectious, immunologic, or hypercoagulable aetiologies, and the timing of complications 9 days following vaccination, point towards an association between influenza vaccination and the ocular findings in our patient). Reporter's Comments: A 47-year-old female patient with concurrent Herpes labialis infection experienced visual symptoms (greyish central spot in right eye), 9 days after receipt of Fluvirin vaccine which was eventually diagnosed as acute macular neuroretinopathy of right eye. The diagnosis were supported by abnormal fundoscopy, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, Humphrey visual field tests and PR-OCTA B-scans. Although, the etiology of the event is unknown, inflammatory and immune vascular mechanisms are postulated. Considering the plausible temporal relationship between vaccination and reported event, the causal role of suspect vaccine cannot be ruled out. Hence, company assessed the event acute macular neuroretinopathy as possibly related to suspect vaccine. However, underlying viral infection (Herpes labialis) is considered as risk factor. The company assessed the case as serious (medically significant).",,,,,,,,,N,,,,"Test Name: Indocyanine green angiography; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: Fluorescein angiogram; Result Unstructured Data: Demonstrated normal transit times and changes consistent with mild vasculitis with late optic nerve staining and peripheral perivascular leakage in the right eye; Test Name: C and P ANCA; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: Antiphospholipid III Ab; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: Bartonella test; Test Result: Negative; Test Name: Homocysteine; Result Unstructured Data: unremarkable (Normal); Test Name: Anticardiolipin Ab; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: Chest X-ray; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: CRP; Result Unstructured Data: unremarkable (Normal); Test Name: Protein electrophoresis; Result Unstructured Data: unremarkable (Normal); Test Name: Protein C/S, Factor V Leiden; Result Unstructured Data: unremarkable (Normal); Test Name: Complete blood count; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: Fundus examination of right eye; Result Unstructured Data: Revealed a few intraretinal blot hemorrhages along with pigment mottling and few drusen in the macula; Test Name: Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c); Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: HIV test; Test Result: Negative; Test Name: Hypercoaguability; Result Unstructured Data: unremarkable (Normal); Test Name: Hyperviscosity; Result Unstructured Data: unremarkable (Normal); Test Name: Lipids; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: Comprehensive metabolic panel; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: Tuberculosis test; Test Result: Negative; Test Name: Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography; Result Unstructured Data: Showed diffuse hyper-reflectivity of the outer plexiform layer (OPL), Henle's layer and the outer nuclear layer (ONL) at and nasal to the fovea; Test Name: ESR; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: Syphilis test; Test Result: Negative; Test Name: B-scan ultrasonography; Result Unstructured Data: Normal; Test Name: Best corrective visual acuity; Result Unstructured Data: Snellen In both eyes; Test Name: Humphrey visual field; Result Unstructured Data: Demonstrated a right superotemporal paracentral scotoma",UNK,,ergocalciferol; omeprazole; valacyclovir,Barrett's esophagus; Herpes labialis; Raynaud's phenomenon,,,USSEQIRUS201806264,2,01/04/2019,,,,

The patient developed an immediate reaction of rash, facial flushing, tightness of throat, difficulty swallowing and shortness of breath (SOB), all of which resulted in an emergency room visit.

This report was received from a consumer therefore; no medical confirmation or assessment of causality is available. Further information is unavailable at the time of this report. The Company's assessment of the causal relationship between these events and FLUBLOK is that there may be a possible relationship based on the reported information that the reactions of rash, facial flushing, tightness of throat, difficulty swallowing and shortness of breath occurred immediately after post injection.

He has been feeling great for 2-3 days after his last cold, so Dr. decided he is well enough to be vaccinated. Maybe this was a poor decision in retrospect, in parents' opinion. 12/15: Patient started feeling lethargic, complained of fatigue, congestion returned again, with minor throat pain. 12/16: Patient woke up tired in the morning, refused his milk and breakfast. He laid on the couch for 4 hours and refused his lunch, saying he is tired and not hungry. He had very mild fever (100 or so). I (dad) took him to urgent care where he was tested for flu (negative) and strep (positive). Discharged with Amoxicillin and 150ml of MOTRIN. Felt better that afternoon, ate 2 full meals, went to bed around 8pm, slept a full night. 12/17: Loss of speech and mobility. Patient woke up super lethargic and tired. When I tried talking to him, his speech was slurred, and his steps were wobbly. Rushed him to ER where they ran a slew of tests on him (blood, strep, CT, Spinal Tap, see below). Spinal tap came back with elevated white blood cells, no initial indication of bacterial growth. Patient's neurological condition was deteriorating quickly (unable to speak or walk properly). By 1-2pm he was transferred to hospital, main floor. By 4pm, he was conscious but not responding to stimuli or cues, including me calling his name. He was transferred to the ICU unit for neurological assessment and monitoring. By end of that day, patient was semi conscious. The diagnosis was Encephalitis, but still no infective agent found. Temp that night about 103F. 12/18: Patient woke up showing more conscious signs but still pretty bad mobility, jittery limbs, jittery head and neck, not talking and not making any sounds.  Cognitively he was not very responsive except to me (dad) and his mom. HHV-6 positive in his CSF but negative in blood, Drs ruled out HHV-6 as potential infection. MRI performed with sedation and contrast at 5pm, results shows hyperintensities suggestive of brain inflammation in brain stem, deep gray matter, basal ganglia. Patient has another dip in mental state, showing little response, not nodding or responding to parents. Fever that day was mild (less than 101 F). Everyone is very concerned about deteriorating state. 12/19 to 12/20: All antibiotic and antiviral drugs are stopped, further blood tests showed no evidence of any active viral or bacterial infection. We ask for patient to be placed on NG tube for nutrition. Patient starts improving slightly cognitively on 12/20, starts playing some games but only for 5-10 mins. Very lethargic still, unable to stand on legs (tested by PT). PICU staff become less concerned about seizure risk. Patient is moved out of PICU to main floor at end of 12/20. Still, patient has not spoken a word, and is unable to sit himself up, walk nor stand, and is in diapers. Medical staff expecting a very slow recovery lasting months, and thus started referral process to rehab. Temps less than 99F. 12/21 to 12/22: More or less same state as on 12/20. Patient is very irritated, although smiles and interacts more with books and games. Started showing more and more signs of cognition. Patient says one word on 12/21 at night (yes, twice, as response to question). On 12/21, Drs and specialists recommend we try IVIG treatment, which starts on 6pm on 12/22. Drs say that IVIG takes about 3-4 days to show any effect, still predicted that patient would need long term rehab. IVIG administered for 2 days. 12/23: Patient wakes up, starts vocalizing some numbers when playing cards with dad. He later walked assisted with me from bed to bathroom door. Improved cognitive response. By end of day, patient was very cognitively aware. 12/24 and 12/25: An avalanche of recovery: Patient recovered 50 to 60% of his speech, is walking minimally assisted to unassisted on 12/25. Patient ran 10 yards on 12/25.  Still tired and fatigued but with improved cognitive response. Started eating pures and soups.  IV removed. Drs calling his recovery 'crazy.' 12/26: Another spike of spontaneous improvement:  Patient is walking unassisted, running around hospital. NG tube removed. Patient discharged, does not qualify for in-patient rehab. Official diagnosis is Meningoencephalitis although no infections were found, neurologist thinks this is a post-infective process but, cannot be 100% sure.  Neurologist recommended an autoimmune serum test (results negative on 1/2/2019). Patient home with follow-up appointments with neurologist and outpatient rehab in a week. 12/28: Patient's speech is almost back to normal. Walking is very stable, but loses balance every now and then, so he is closely monitored at home. He is very irritable compared to before. He is suffering from sensitivity to light and noise. Cries much more than before. Still not sure if this is chronic or not. Hopefully this goes away with time. Week of 1/1/2019: Patient is back to about 100% his energy, functional and cognitive abilities. Remaining minor sensitivity to noise, light, and irritability, are slowly improving with time.

Scratched absentmindedly, felt a tiny conical bump. Within seconds, itch returned more severely. I looked, saw a tiny red bump, perhaps 1cm in diameter. As I have learned-- then and since --, ANY scratching results in highly-intensified itching, and enlargement of the bump to either a flattened red bump up to c.5cm diameter OR a welt as long as 60cm. The itching is severe, scratching is hard to control and can produce mild bleeding. Salves and lotions have no effect; some anti-itch sprays are quickly effective. Adverse outbreaks have occurred as much as 3 times per year since 2014, but as infrequently as once every 2 years. The most provocative outbreak occurred during a road trip in approximately late July, 2015.  My two-years-older brother and I broke out in intensive itching red bumps over perhaps 40% of our torsos, legs, arms, and feet within an hour of taking a room at a modest-cost motel. My brother's adoptive son in the same motel room experienced no symptoms. We brothers barely slept that night. While my symptoms diminished to nearly negligible over the next 3 days, my brother's symptoms raged for 5 days and diminished slowly over two weeks. Upon our return, my brother's regular doctor saw us together and called in an on-duty dermatologist to see us; the dermatologist gave us a 5-minute look-over and, with no evidence or further research whatsoever, flatly declared that this was an insect attack. The fact that there have been near-identical repeat adverse outbreaks both before and many times since that road trip suggest that her [rather ungracious and hurried] knee-jerk diagnosis has no basis in fact or evidence. Both brothers have been examined by Dr. In email communications with Patient/Reporter, Dr. initially rejected any connection between the injection and the hereindescribed adverse events, but eventually in a single email [no longer showing in email record system as available to this patient] acknowledged the medical possibility that a relationship might exist between the Zoster injection and the repeat adverse events.

On 08.17.2017, I wrote to Dr. Are you aware of anyone researching /writing up this poss. post-varicella-zoster injection reaction? I guarantee you this is NOT scabies or any other insect -- we both have 3-decade live-in partners & occasional guests, no-one else affected, no infestations, no roughing-it backcountry or remote foreign travel, period. MAYBE a motel chemical cleaner could have triggered this eruption, but not earlier ones. This is an agonizing, worse-than-bad-poison-oak condition. As no-one has offered any functional relief or explanation, isn't it intelligent to push the extents of the inquiry? Two brothers who see each other no more than monthly, live separate lives, both develop very similar conditions within one month after varicella-zoster injection.

Follow-up was received on 07-JAN-2019 from the patient's mother concerning her currently 21 year old son. In 1997 (also reported as when the patient was an infant), the patient was vaccinated with M-M-R II (dose, route, and lot # not provided) and reported as DTaP; (manufacturer not specified). The mother reported that her son was developing normally when he was an infant but he began to have autism symptoms after the vaccination. The mother further reported that in approximately 1999 (reported as when he was at age 2 or 3), he was diagnosed with severe autism. She also reported that her son has been in a lot of pain over the years and he suffered from seizures (he was taking an unspecified medication to control this) (onset date for these were not provided). The patient was non-verbal, had sensory issues, had to cover his ears due to sound in the environment, and had aggressive episodes (these were considered symptoms of autism). In addition, on unspecified date(s), the patient was hospitalized in behavioral institutions for self-biting (considered symptom of autism) and other unspecified issues. When asked if the patient sought medical attention and if treatment was given for the events, the mother answered ""yes"" to both. She also stated that her son has never been able to have a normal life. When asked if the patient had any drug reactions or allergies, the mother's response was seasonal allergies (this was coded as an event since the patient received the vaccines as an infant and the onset date is unknown). The reporter believed that the Company's M-M-R II was responsible for her son's severe autism. She did not specify causality for the other events. She also stated that she was part of a class action lawsuit in 2005 filed against vaccine makers. The reporter also asked if the Company's vaccines contained thimerosal or preservatives. She believes pharmaceutical companies are ""too big and strong"" and that the federal government needs to protect children from receiving unsafe vaccines that contain toxins. The patient's present status was reported to be not recovered. The following events were considered disabling by the mother as she reported that her son was never able to live a normal life: autism, seizures, pain, and other unspecified issues for which he was hospitalized in behavioral institutions. Upon internal review, autism and seizures were considered to be medically significant.

The event was reported to me (ARNP) immediately by our staff and my nurse. LPN reported that the patient was sitting on the exam table for the blood draw from her left AC and then received her TDaP and flu vaccines. Then she received the HPV vaccine and was told to lie down for 15 minutes after. Just as LPN turned to set the vaccine/lab draw tray to the side, the patient let out a small sound and then fell forward from the exam table. Based on the reported mechanism of the fall and the areas in which the patient reported pain (knees and forehead), suspect she first hit her knees and then her head. LOC less than 30 seconds as the nurse reports she immediately returned to consciousness. Mother of patient was just outside of the room making a phone call regarding her own mother when the event happened. Mother of patient was immediately back in the room following the event. Patient was monitored for approximately 1 hour following the event with plans for close follow up. She reported localized knee pain bilaterally, headache, and nausea immediately following the event. Reported pain at 10/10. Patient's legs were elevated and she remained in a lying position with both mother and myself present for 15 minutes. She received a dose of ZOFRAN to help with her nausea and remained in a lying position on the floor with her head cushioned and feet elevated on a chair. 15 minutes later she was slowly brought to a position sitting on the floor and leaning against the cabinets. She received a dose of acetaminophen. Mother was present with the patient. She was rechecked by me 15 minutes later and pain was reassessed and reported to be 6/10. A neurological examination was then performed, first with the patient sitting in a chair and then slowly standing. Nonfocal neurological examination. However, I suspected she may be experiencing early signs of a concussion given the fall and her symptoms of dizziness, headache, and nausea, so I thoroughly discussed concussion protocol with patient and parent. Both verbalized understanding.

Patient then was not seen in clinic again until 11/16/2018 with a chief complaint of difficulty focusing and headaches.

The patient's past medical history included human bite. Concomitant products included povidone-iodine (Betadine). In September 2018, the patient received BOOSTRIX. In September 2018, 1 day after receiving BOOSTRIX, the patient experienced cellulitis (serious criteria GSK medically significant), difficulty breathing, nausea and wrong vaccine administered. On 6th December 2018, the patient experienced viral infection, nasal congestion and chronic fatigue. In December 2018, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria GSK medically significant), whooping cough (serious criteria GSK medically significant), fever, enlargement of lymph nodes, decreased appetite and sleepiness. On an unknown date, the patient experienced feeling abnormal. The patient was treated with bronchodilator (nos) (Bronchodilator) and cough cold preparations nos (Cough Syrup). On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, nasal congestion, fever, enlargement of lymph nodes and wrong vaccine administered were unknown and the outcome of the whooping cough, difficulty breathing, viral infection, chronic fatigue, decreased appetite and feeling abnormal were not recovered/not resolved and the outcome of the cellulitis was recovering/resolving and the outcome of the nausea and sleepiness were recovered/resolved. It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, whooping cough, difficulty breathing, viral infection, nasal congestion, nausea, chronic fatigue, fever, enlargement of lymph nodes, decreased appetite, feeling abnormal and sleepiness to be related to BOOSTRIX. The reporter considered the cellulitis to be unrelated to BOOSTRIX. Additional details were received as follows: The patient received BOOSTRIX following a human bite in emergency room. Shortly after it was cleaned with betadine and washed thoroughly. The next morning, the patient couldn't breathe when she woke up and felt like she was going to throw up. She did develop cellulitis at the site of the bite. About 4 weeks back from the date of reporting, the patient developed an illness at the same time as her family member. The family member recovered from the illness quickly, but the patient still felt terrible. When the illness started she could not breathe through her nose and she felt like she was going to throw up. She was extremely fatigued and slept for about 3 days. After about 3 weeks she felt like the virus finished incubating.  The patient developed a fever of 101 degree F and a terrible cough, like whooping cough. For 2 days, when the cough was at its worst, she could cough so hard that she was unable to breathe. A bronchodilator did not help, but she has had some benefit from cough syrup. Her pharmacist told her that the bronchodilator did not work because the problem was with swollen lymph nodes and not her lungs. Her appetite was low and she felt horrific for the past 4 weeks. She had seen physicians twice for this illness and felt like she suffered from chronic fatigue. She slowly felt better, but still feels terrible, fatigued and out of breath.

She started complaining of her left knee and nurse was holding her forehead saying she fell over the right side of the exam table and onto her forehead. Patient was quickly calmed down and told she had fallen, as she was asking what happened.  It became apparent quickly that she must have fainted immediately following her last shot and subsequently fallen off the exam table when nurse was reaching for the sharps container. Nurse said she had just put the bandaid on the injection site and patient had no immediate complaints or signs of impending syncope. Patient, still sitting on floor, was quickly coherent and ice compress was applied to head within just a few minutes of fall. She mentioned she had not eaten anything at all today because she thought she might need labs drawn and wanted to be ready for them. Juice was given to patient to drink while sitting in floor with nurse. Once she completed the juice box and reported that she felt no dizziness or light-headedness, she was helped by myself and nurse to a chair directly behind her. A brief neurological exam showed no signs of confusion or changes in level of consciousness. Patient began then complaining of her left wrist, which was starting to appear slightly edematous with some erythema to top and radial wrist. Patient was alert and joking with her mother about the incident and did not appear to be experiencing any concerning symptoms at that time.

Within seconds, her pain level had reached a 9/10 on 0-10 pain scale and she felt weak, shaky and that she was going to pass out. She was at a local business, but had to lay on the floor and request help. They brought her water (she drank about 90 oz within a few minutes), gave her some ibuprofen and sat with her until a relative came. She thought about going to ER but says that after about one hour laying down there she felt okay to go to home. That evening, she developed some mild fever and chills. She reported minimal swelling at injection site and minimal redness but states she has very limited movement and strength in her arm. She describes it pretty much as an ""arm paralysis"". She denies any airway involvement nor rash. But even after two days (she reported to me on 01/11/2019) she still doesn't feel very good, still has little movement in her arm and almost no strength. She is taking ibuprofen 800 mg every six hours and Benadryl about the same schedule.

She spoke with an NP today and was Rx'd prednisone x 5 days to see if there was any benefit. Both providers agreed that she has nerve involvement from the inflammation process in her arm. She doesn't feel shaky, chilled or any other symptoms at this time besides her arm pain and limited movement. She does plan to potentially follow up with her PMD, Dr especially if no further improvement from the prednisone. Again, she denies any respiratory involvement, no rash, no major swelling or redness.

On an unspecified date in Oct-2018, within 24 hours of vaccination, the patient experienced symptoms of fever (greater than 101-degree F) for over 24 hours, chest pain, back pain, trouble in breathing and intense cough (wet). The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and was subsequently hospitalized on 20-Oct-2018. Due to the onset of pneumonia, the doctor had advised the patient to interrupt methotrexate for a week and a half. It was reported that the diagnostic tests were not available as they were performed at the hospital. The patient was prescribed with azithromycin. On 23-Oct-2018, the patient was discharged from the hospital in febrile condition. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date. The patient was asymptomatic. The reporter assessed this case as serious due to hospitalization. Follow-up received from other health professional on 04-Dec-2018: Added current condition (still's disease) in patient's tab and concomitant medication (methotrexate) in the product's tab.

The patient had no historical or current condition. The patient did not receive any concomitant medications. On 21-Dec-2018, the patient was administered FLUCELVAX QIVc (influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, cell-culture-derived, dose: 0.5 ml, route of administration: intramuscular, anatomical location: deltoid, batch number: 252685 and expiry date: 30-Jun-2019) for influenza prophylaxis. On 05-Jan-2019, 15 days after vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza. On the same day, the patient was hospitaliszd. At the time of this report, the patient was in intensive care unit (ICU) and was diagnosed with fulminant myocarditis. The reporter was concerned about the quality of the product the patient was given (explicitly coded as suspected product quality issue). The patient had not recovered from the events. The reporter assessed the case as serious (hospitalization).; Reporter's Comments: A 38-year-old, female patient was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza, 15 days after administration of FLUCELVAX QIV followed by fulminant myocarditis. Considering the implausible temporal relationship, the event of H1N1 influenza was assessed as not related to suspect vaccine as vaccination usually requires minimum 2-3 weeks to provide immune protection against influenza. Despite temporal association between vaccination and event of fulminant myocarditis, the clinical course suggests the reported H1N1 influenza as a more plausible explanation for the event. Hence, the company assessed the causality as not related to suspect vaccine. There is lack of information with respect to nature/cause of the reported event of suspected product quality issue and the company assessed the event as unassessable. The case will be further assessed upon receipt of follow up information. The company assessed the case as serious (medically significant).",,,,,Y,,,,N,12/21/2018,01/05/2019,15,,UNK,,,,Comments: None,,USSEQIRUS201900379,2,01/16/2019,,,,

The concomitant medications included Ferrous sulfate for anemia and Prenatal vitamins [minerals nos, vitamins nos] for pregnancy. The estimated delivery date (EDD) was 12-Jan-2019.

Pt reported no significant change in pain. Hospitalist Initial H&P: moaning, writhing in pain; there is a very tiny area of ecchymoses in the right upper biceps at the site of recent vaccine injection. Discharge summary: ""... severe arm pain started almost immediately after receiving shingles vaccine. Shingles vaccine was given superiorly in the right arm very near the AC joint. The pain was described as a shooting pain down her arm, however passive range of motion was intact without really increasing the pain but it did hurt with palpation overlying the injection site. Given that she had no passive range of motion, swelling, or erythema around the site I felt septic joint was very unlikely and we had better reason for her fevers which improved with treatment of her UTI. Given the neurologic component of the pain I prescribed her 100 mg of gabapentin 3 times daily which controlled the pain very well and about an hour after the first dose she was able to actively move her arm with minimally increasing the pain. Again this favors against the diagnosis of septic joint. Her pain was well-controlled on gabapentin and overall improving, I will give her a seven-day course of gabapentin 100mg TID and counseled her extensively that this should not be a chronic medication as I would expect inflammation from the vaccine to decrease over the course of the next 7 days. She agrees with this plan and has stated that she does not want to be on gabapentin chronically for this.""

The injection was administered in the right deltoid. The next morning 11/27, I woke up and had a very difficult time moving out of bed due to low R back pain that had not been there when I went to bed on 11/26. I stood up and pain was also in R mid buttock, making it difficult to walk with a normal gait (I was limping); I was quite alarmed. I used the bathroom, my menstrual cycle started. It was extremely painful to even clean myself after using the bathroom. My body felt very swollen, esp at injection sight (I am aware swelling at injection sight is normal) and across my entire abdomen, both buttocks, hips and both thighs. I felt as if I had lost control over my abdominal/trunk muscles. I felt stiff all over. As the day went on, the pain in my R buttock seemed to shoot around the front to my anterior hip, down the front and side of my R thigh to my knee as well as my anterior lower leg to ankle. I could not lift my R leg to dress or undress myself due to weakness and shooting pain. The pain was so intense at times I felt nauseated. I was unable to lie flat on my back or stomach because the pain intensity from my anterior R hip to my knee. I was unable to stand up straight or in one position more than 30seconds before feeling the need to sit or somehow shift my weight to attempt alleviation of the pain intensity. I also found myself walking with a stooped posture. Despite daily applications of heat, ice, stretching, taking Epsom salt baths every other day, 2400mg ibuprofen daily, massage therapy and applications of various topical analgesics I was not getting relief. Walking and standing were very difficult. I was awakened 3-5 times during the night due to discomfort. Getting out of bed in the morning was particularly challenging--much gentle stretching was needed to get my day started. I am (WAS, prior to the injection) an avid gym-goer and was unable to even walk on the treadmill more than 1-2 mins before needing to stop because the pain was too intense to continue. The pain seemed to 'float' between the areas I described above, some days the R buttock was the focal point of the pain, others days it was more prominent in my anterior or lateral thigh, or anterior hip. Discomfort was consistent in my Right knee daily. I believe that the vaccine also had a negative effect on my hormones: despite a menstrual cycle that began on 11/27 (lasting 5 days), another menstrual cycle started on 12/14 (lasting a full 8 days), and again 1/9/2019. This is a very abnormal pattern I've been experiencing over the past year prior to this vaccination, which, despite peri menopause would occur every 4-8 weeks. I would also like to mention that last year, 2017, I received the flu vax in my L arm and experienced VERY similar symptoms the day after, body swelling, Left low back and buttock pain, and my menstrual cycle was triggered. Severe pain in my L shoulder joint (I am STILL experiencing a sharp pain in that joint to this day w range of motion). Those symptoms lasted at least a month or more but not as intense. I tried speaking with a couple of my physicians about the issues I experienced after that particular vax but I had nothing to back up my suspicions of an adverse reaction. Now, since I had the injection on the right side this year I feel there is some sort of correlation to the vaccination having a negative effect on my body and my suspicions are validated. Since this most recent vax, I have had x2 Family medicine office visits, hip x-rays (negative). I had  an appointment with sports medicine on 12/28/18. I have been working closely with my naturopath for energy work, chiropractic therapy and oral supplements. Also massage and lymphatic drainage therapies as another natural healing pathway, and continuing Epsom salt baths every 2-3 days. These modalities have produced a breakthrough in my healing, most notably on the dates of 1/10 and 1/11. I am sleeping through the night and able to walk without feeling pain. I will admit I am still experiencing mild discomfort in my anterior right leg which continues to include my right knee. Even though my body has started to loosen and I'm regaining range of motion, my low back remains extremely tight and stiff. I still need to stretch every morning to loosen my hips and back in order to start the day. I suspect this issue is a result of trying to alleviate the pain by compensating my posture and gait for over a month. Again, I am working closely with my naturopath and massage therapist to correct. The effects of this vaccination has been debilitating and disruptive to my life, my work and my health. Every aspect of my life has been affected and negatively impacted. I need help and guidance regarding this situation which is why I'm reaching out to you. Something is wrong and something needs to be done. I welcome any feedback or information you can provide.

Concurrent medical conditions included hemodialysis. Concomitant products included Hepatitis B vaccine, Hepatitis B vaccine and Hepatitis B vaccine. On an unknown date, the patient received the 4th dose of Hepatitis B vaccine. On an unknown date, unknown after receiving Hepatitis B vaccine, the patient experienced hepatitis B (serious criteria hospitalization and GSK medically significant) and shortness of breath (serious criteria hospitalization). On an unknown date, the outcome of the hepatitis B and shortness of breath were unknown. The reporter considered the hepatitis B and shortness of breath to be related to Hepatitis B vaccine. Additional information was provided. This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of hepatitis B virus infection in a patient unspecified age and gender who was vaccinated with unspecified hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. The patient was started on haemodialysis in 2010. There was no evidence that the patient had ever been tested for HBV. The patient's vaccination status was also unknown. No information on patient's family history or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months, the patient received 4 doses of unspecified HBV vaccine (administration route and site unspecified; batch number not provided for both) as recommended for haemodialysis patients. The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date in 2010, an unknown period after vaccination, the patient had post-vaccination testing and was positive for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs: 82 mIU/mL), indicating immunity to HBV. Post vaccination HBsAg testing was performed with a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved assay at Laboratory was negative. As recommended for patients with demonstrated immunity, only anti-HBs was monitored routinely from 2010 to 2016 to ensure continued protection (anti-HBs more than 10 mIU/mL). In 2016, the patient was hospitalised for acute shortness of breath, and an HBsAg test was performed as part of a routine evaluation at laboratory and was found to be positive, indicating a current infection with HBV. The positive result was confirmed by additional testing at commercial and public health laboratories. Insufficient data were available to determine whether the patient acquired HBV infection before or after vaccination. After the positive HBsAg results were reported, an epidemiologic investigation was initiated to determine the cause of the false-negative test results and to identify any HBV transmission. A blood sample was collected in April 2017 and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to confirm the HBV diagnosis. CDC testing found high HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels (14,200,000 IU/mL), evidence of immunity (anti-HBs equal to 114 mIU/mL), and HBsAg positivity by one assay and negativity by another assay. Sequencing the S gene of HBV DNA identified an sG145R surface antigen mutation. This mutation is associated with false-negative results, which explains the failure of multiple tests to identify the patient as being HBsAg-positive. None of the contacts had prior evidence of HBV infection, all were screened by tests capable of detecting this mutant virus (using a suitable HBsAg assay or by HBV DNA), and all test results were negative, indicating no evidence of HBV transmission, despite the potential exposures to the HBV-infected patient. Family members without evidence of prior HBV vaccination were also advised to complete the HBV vaccination series. This case has been considered serious due to hospitalisation. Treatment was unknown. The outcome of the event was not reported. The authors stated, ""Insufficient data were available to determine whether the patient acquired HBV infection before or after vaccination. This case highlights a unique challenge associated with detecting HBV infections when a surface antigen mutation is present"". Following internal check, it was noticed that the initial GSK receipt date was incorrectly recorded as 14 January 2018 instead of 16 January 2019.

On 05-Nov-2018, the patient was administered FLUCELVAX (QIVc) [influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, cell-culture derived, dose: 0.5 ml, route of administration, anatomical location, batch number and expiry date: not reported] for protection against seasonal influenza. On 06-Nov-2018, the patient developed hives all over the body and swelling of the eyes, wrists, knees, and fingers. On an unspecified date in Nov-2018, the patient went to the emergency room (ER), where she was given Benadryl (diphenhydramine, paracetamol, phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride) and unspecified steroid shot and was sent to home. The reporter stated that the swelling and hives had not gone away. At the time of the report, the patient had not recovered from the events.  The reporter assessed the case as non-serious. This case was considered as lost to follow up, as the reporter had not given the consent to follow up. Follow-up received from the consumer on 15-Jan-2019: Med info number (SEQ19-00290) was added in additional information tab. This case was considered as lost to follow-up, since the consumer has not given consent to provide further information. It was confirmed that, the consumer couldn't provide the lot number. No new information was available. Hence, no changes were made in the narrative.; Reporter's Comments: A 19-year-old female patient experienced hives all over the body, swelling of eyes, wrist and knees, 1 day after receipt of FLUCELVAX QIVc vaccine. Considering the plausible temporal relationship between vaccination and reported events, plausible biological mechanism and lack of any underlying conditions or alternative more plausible causes, the company assessed the events as possibly related to suspect vaccine. The company assessed this case as serious (medically significant).",,,,,,,,,N,11/05/2018,11/06/2018,1,,UNK,,,,,,USSEQIRUS201805273,2,01/24/2019,,,Y,

The complainant stated that the vial was inverted when removing the needle from the vial. The complainant stated that air was introduced into the vial prior to extracting the doses.

As the secured lock was popped off the vial the rubber stopper was dented in and off a little. It was reported that, when the nurses removed the hard cap and stuck the needle in the middle, there was a corner on the top where the rubber stopper was dented in causing a hole where the medication leaked. The vials leaked and only 4 vials were leaking so far.

There were only 5 doses left out of the 10 doses in the vial. It was reported that sample vials were available in which they had one opened vial and 46 left. The package was not damaged, but the rubber stopper was damaged. From the withdrawal of first vaccine, the leakage was observed. The needle used was 25-gauge needle and the syringe were 3 ml syringe.

Based on the QA investigation report, it was concluded that FLUCELVAX Batch 252234 was manufactured in compliance with the approved internal procedures and in accordance with the quality requirements. No internal root cause was identified in the manufacturing process. A known trend was identified for the FLUCELVAX batches from the 2018/2019 FLUCELVAX commercial season for vials leaking at the stopper during dosing. A review revealed that the complainant was adding air to the vial prior to extracting doses and was inverting the vial when withdrawing the needle from the stopper. It is known that the addition of air to the vial can over pressurize the vial and cause leaking. In addition, inverting the vial while trying to extract a dosage can increase the potential for the vial to leak. The root cause for this investigation was found to be user-improper handling.

It was reported that, the vial was held upside down and every time when a dose was pulled from the vial, it was leaking. Two doses were already lost. The defect was discovered during drawing up of the vaccine. The package and the vials were not damaged or wet. The leakage was observed after withdrawal of first dose of 7-8 doses. The needle of size 22 gauge was used to draw vaccine from 5 ml syringe. No adverse event was reported after administration of the vaccine. This case: 201804249 was linked to case: 201804221 reported by the same reporter. This case was associated with product quality complaint, hence quality assurance investigation (QAI) had been requested and the corresponding product technical complaint (PTC) reference number was 1033781. Based on the QA investigation, it was concluded that, the Batch Production Records and Manufacturing Systems involved in batch 252235, found it to be unlikely that the leaking vial defect identified in this complaint was the result of the manufacturing process at the facility. The complainant stated that the vial was inverted when removing the needle from the vial. The complainant stated that air was introduced into the vial prior to extracting the doses. Both the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Library of Medicine indicated that injecting air was not recommended because it would cause leaking or spritzing of the vaccine from the vial. It had been established that the addition of air to the vial could over pressurize the vial and cause leaking and this practice was not recommended.

It was reported that, the vial was held upside down and every time when a dose was pulled from the vial, it was leaking. Two doses were already lost. The defect was discovered during drawing up of the vaccine. The package and the vials were not damaged or wet. The leakage was observed after withdrawal of first dose out of 7-8 doses. The needle of size 22 gauge was used to draw vaccine from 5 ml syringe. No adverse event was reported after administration of the vaccine. This case is linked to original case 201804221 (same reporter). This case was associated with product quality complaint, hence quality assurance investigation (QAI) had been requested and the corresponding product technical complaint (PTC) reference number was 1033781. Based on the QA investigation, it was concluded that, the Batch Production Records and Manufacturing Systems involved in batch 252235, found it to be unlikely that the leaking vial defect identified in this complaint was the result of the manufacturing process at the facility. The complainant stated that the vial was inverted when removing the needle from the vial. The complainant stated that air was introduced into the vial prior to extracting the doses. Both the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and National Library of Medicine indicated that injecting air was not recommended because it would cause leaking or spritzing of the vaccine from the vial. It had been established that the addition of air to the vial could over pressurize the vial and cause leaking and this practice was not recommended. The root cause for the leaking FLUCELVAX MDV of batch 252235 was due to user or improper handling. The reporter assessed the case as non-serious.

A known trend was identified for the FLUCELVAX batches from the 2018/2019 FLUCELVAX commercial season for vials leaking at the stopper during dosing. A review revealed that the complainant was adding air to the vial prior to extracting doses and was inverting the vial when withdrawing the needle from the stopper. It was known that the addition of air to the vial can over pressurize the vial and cause leaking. In addition, inverting the vial while trying to extract a dosage can increase potential for the vial to leak. The root cause for this investigation was found to be user-improper handling. The reporter assessed this case as non-serious. Follow-up report received from QA department on 19-Nov-2018: The QA investigation report stated that, the root cause for the leaking FLUCELVAX MDV of Batch 252234 was due to user or improper handling.

Based on the QA investigation, it was concluded that, the Batch Production Records and Manufacturing Systems involved in Batch 252235, found it to be unlikely that the Leaking Vial defect identified in this complaint was the result of the manufacturing process at the facility. The complainant stated that the vial was inverted when removing the needle from the vial. The complainant stated that air was introduced into the vial prior to extracting the doses. Both the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Library of Medicine indicated that injection air was not recommended because it would cause leaking or spritzing of the vaccine from the vial. It has been established that the addition of air to the vial could over pressurize the vial and cause leaking and this practice was not recommended.

In or around 09-JAN-2015 the patient was inoculated with ZOSTAVAX for routine health maintenance and for its intended purpose: the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster). Shortly after receiving, ZOSTAVAX, the patient suffered sudden and total sensorineural hearing loss of the left ear. As a direct and proximate result of ZOSTAVAX vaccine, the patient's symptoms have resulted in physical limitations not present prior to using ZOSTAVAX. The patient also experienced mental and emotional distress due to resulting physical limitations and seriousness of her condition. As a result of ZOSTAVAX, the patient sustained severe and permanent personal injuries. Further, as a tragic consequence the patient suffered serious, progressive, permanent, and incurable injuries, as well as significant conscious pain and suffering, mental anguish, emotional distress, loss of enjoyment of life, physical impairment and injury. As a direct and proximate result the patient has suffered and incurred damages, including medical expenses; the loss of accumulations; and other economic and non-economic damages. As a direct and proximate consequence, the patient sustained serious personal injuries and related losses including, but not limited to, the following: a. the patient required and will continue to require healthcare and services; b. The patient incurred and will continue to incur medical and related expenses; and c. The patient suffered and will continue to suffer mental anguish, physical pain and suffering, diminished capacity for the enjoyment of life, a diminished quality of life, and other losses and damages.

I saw my doctor in November 2014 and was diagnosed with chronic hives of unknown source. Also, I began experiencing muscle, nerve and joint pains, sensitivity to touch, extreme weight gain and purple striae. I was unable to get the hives under control with medications and began seeing an allergist who stated it was something autoimmune that had been triggered and it wasn't anything environmental causing the hives. I obtained a second opinion and they had stated the same thing. I had seen endocrinology, allergy/immunology, neurology, rheumatology and several general practitioners who all could not and still cannot find a cause for the development. I now have to be injected with several thousand dollar injection to control the hives and still have to take an antihistamine. My mother had done research and found articles stating the GARDASIL had unlisted side effects, one including an autoimmune disorder. Also, I was speaking with a coworker whose niece had the same problem but worse. My hives are triggered by anything, heat/cold, touch, pressure, lotions, etc. I still have not been able to lose the weight and swell up at times, so badly I can barely bend my neck. My eyes are constantly itchy and swollen and I had never had allergies or pain before this.

It is known that the addition of air to the vial can over pressurize the vial and cause leaking.

798509,01/26/2019,CA,48.0,48,,F,,"I received the flu vaccine and about 5 minutes later started to feel symptoms. The first sign was numbness in my upper gums and cheeks and jawline. It was a tingling numbness. It increased to cover my whole head and I notified my  husband who was with me that I wasn't feeling right. He notified the nurse who put us back in the room where we received the shot. I felt woozy when I stood up to walk to the room. In the room, the symptoms increased to cover my arms and legs. I also started to feel ""inebriated"" and started laughing at things that weren't funny. The numbness increased to muscle twitching and my whole body eventually was twitching. I would try to control it, but could only make my body stop for short periods. The nurse brought the doctor in and I described how I was feeling, but it took all the self-control I could muster to form sentences that made sense and had a regular cadence to them. This is a very similar reaction to the one I get when I take levaquin or ingest mint/mint oil.  The adverse reactions to flouroquinolone that the FDA just added to all of this group of antibiotics is one I first experienced over ten years ago:  ""Across the fluoroquinolone antibiotic class, a range of mental health side effects are already described in the Warnings and Precautions section of the drug labeling, but differed by individual drug. The new class-wide labeling changes will require that the mental health side effects be listed separately from other central nervous system side effects and be consistent across the labeling of the fluoroquinolone class. The mental health side effects to be included in the labeling across all the fluoroquinolones are disturbances in attention, disorientation, agitation, nervousness, memory impairment and delirium.""  My husband tried to explain this to the doctor. In retrospect, he didn't seem familiar with these new anti-biotic warnings (which we didn't know were officially added by the FDA yet, but we knew the symptoms. The next day we did research and found the new warnings which really helped us!). The doctor had the nurse administer benadryl because we have learned from my past episodes that the benadryl helps ease the muscle twitching and he ordered an EKG just as a precaution because I had had a very small and mild heart attack in August of 2015.  My heart was fine. He asked me some more questions and he said that the symptoms didn't appear to be harming me and I should just wait it out and sometimes we just don't know why things happen. My husband very carefully walked me to my car and I remained at home all day waiting for the symptoms to stop. The muscle twitching calmed down after about an hour and a half. The mental adverse effects took more like 5 hours. The next day, after a reaction like this, my body is weak from all the muscle twitching. This was the same. I believe the anti-biotic contained inside the FLUBLOK QUADRIVALENT must have had some type of fluoroquinolone in it.

Considering the no known biological mechanism for the event chronic kidney stones due to flu vaccine, the causality was assessed as not related to suspect vaccine. Also as the vaccine was given during 34th week of gestation and event reported as chronic, the causal role of suspect vaccine can be ruled out. The patient also experienced low platelets (1,19,000), 1 month 18 days post vaccination. Considering the plausible immunological etiology, and plausible temporal relationship the causal role of study vaccine cannot be ruled out. Hence, the causality assessed as related to study vaccine. The underlying low platelets is considered as confounding factor. The event drug exposure during pregnancy was assessed as not related to suspect vaccine considering the event as special situation.

The patient's mother did not have a prior history of use of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy. The last menstrual period (LMP) date of the patient's mother was 12-May-2018. The type of pregnancy was singleton. The pregnancy status of the patient was collected, and no pregnancy complications were noted. On 10-Aug-2018, the patient's mother underwent prenatal tests for cystic fibrosis which revealed no major congenital malformation. On the same day, 1st trimester screening was also performed and was noted that the patient was positive for the risk of Down's syndrome. On 18-Aug-2018, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) was performed, and no major congenital malformations were noted. On 08-Sep-2018, 2nd trimester screening was performed, and no major congenital malformations were noted. Concomitant medication included Vitafol one for healthy pregnancy. On 06-Oct-2018, at approximately 21 weeks of gestation, the patient's mother received FLUCELVAX QIVc (influenza vaccine, subunit influenza virus vaccine polyvalent, cell-culture derived, batch number: 252232, dose, route of administration, anatomical location, expiry date: not reported) for an unknown indication.

The event preterm birth have multifactorial aetiology. Considering the implausible temporal relationship between vaccination to events onset and no known biological mechanism post-vaccination, the event preterm birth with low birth weight were assessed as not related to suspect vaccine. The high risk of down syndrome during pregnancy screening can be other possible risk factor.

The mother had one previous pregnancy with full term live birth. The mother had no history of offspring with major congenital malformations. The mother had no relevant maternal and paternal medical history with major congenital malformations. The mother did not use tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs during pregnancy. The mother's current condition included low iron (since an unspecified date). The mother's concomitant medications included OB complete one (as reported) for healthy pregnancy and Ferrous sulphate (reported as ferrouSul) for low iron. The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 12-Apr-2018. The type of pregnancy was singleton. On 16-Oct-2018, at gestation age of 25 weeks, the fetus received FLUCELVAX QIVc [batch number: 252232, route of administration: transplacental, dose, anatomical location, and expiry date: not reported] (explicitly coded as foetal exposure during pregnancy) for an unknown indication.

The patient had no previous pregnancy. The patient had no history of offspring with major congenital malformation. Also, the patient had no maternal or paternal history with major congenital malformations. The patient did not have a prior history of use of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy. The patient's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 12-May-2018. The type of pregnancy was singleton. The pregnancy status of the patient was collected, and no pregnancy complications were noted. On 10-Aug-2018, the patient underwent prenatal tests for cystic fibrosis which revealed no major congenital malformation. On the same day, 1st trimester screening was also performed and was noted that the patient was positive for the risk of Down's syndrome. On 18-Aug-2018, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) was performed, and no major congenital malformations were noted. On 08-Sep-2018, 2nd trimester screening was performed, and no major congenital malformations were noted. The patient's concomitant medications included VITAFOL-ONE for healthy pregnancy. On 06-Oct-2018, at gestation age of 21 weeks, the patient was administered FLUCELVAX QIVc [batch number: 252232, dose, route of administration, anatomical location, expiry date: not reported] for an unknown indication. On an unspecified date, after vaccination, the patient experienced haemorrhoids and constipation. On 10-Nov-2018, the patient started the treatment with ANUSOL-HC cream (2.5 percent, bid, topically) for haemorrhoids and COLACE tablet (10 mg, bid, orally) for constipation. At the gestational age of 35.7 weeks, the patient gave birth to a male infant vaginally of weight: 2340 g, length 44.5 cm, head circumference of 30.5 cm. The patient's appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration (APGAR) score at one minute and five minutes was 9 and at ten minutes was unknown. There were no pregnancy complications and major congenital malformations observed. The patient's estimated date of delivery (EDD) was reported as 16-Feb-2019. At the time of this report, the outcome of the events was not reported. This case is linked to (201900958), the corresponding baby report. Significant case amendment (26-Nov-2018): Patient's historical condition (positive for the risk of Down's syndrome) was re-coded as current condition in the patient tab. No changes were made in the narrative. Follow up received from the other health professional on 24-Jan-2019: At the gestational age of 35.7 weeks, the patient gave birth to a male infant vaginally of weight: 2340 g, length 44.5 cm, head circumference of 30.5 cm. The patient's appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration (APGAR) score at one minute and five minutes was 9 and at ten minutes was unknown. Amended narrative accordingly. Significant case amendment (24-Jan-2019): The case was upgraded from non-serious to serious as new event 'premature delivery' (medically significant event) was added in the follow-up. Amended narrative accordingly. Reporter's Comments: A 30-year-old female pregnant patient experienced haemorrhoids and constipation, on an unknown date after vaccination with FLUCELVAX QIVc (vaccine exposure during pregnancy) and gave birth to a male infant vaginally at gestational age of 35.7 weeks. The company assessed the causality of the events (haemorrhoids and constipation) as not related as it can be explained by pregnancy status of the patient. The decision to administer a vaccine during pregnancy is related to medical decision making by the mother and her physician and is not related to any property of the medication. The event drug exposure during pregnancy was assessed as not related considering the intended use of the vaccine. Considering the implausible temporal relationship between vaccination and reported event of premature delivery (3 months 10 days after vaccination), no evidence for a biological mechanism that could cause the event and incidental nature of the events, the events were assessed as not related to the vaccination. The company assessed the event 'pre-mature delivery' as serious (medically significant).",,,,,,,,,U,10/06/2018,10/06/2018,0,,UNK,,VITAFOL ONE,Down's syndrome (1st trimester screening noted that the patient was screen positive for the risk of Down's syndrome),,,USSEQIRUS201805958,2,02/06/2019,,,,

VISIT -  RECEIVED PNEUMONIA SHOT PNEUMOVAX-23 Received Pneumonia shot and when returned home, immediately had to lay down, very ill feeling, with very red, swollen painful arm. I called back to the Dr office and they were closed. A friend was reassuring that it will get better and if not call Dr. I called Dr. on Monday Dec 18 regarding concern of continued poor shot reaction and pain. Jan9 I called Dr. again regarding continued pain and he assured me the reaction would go away.  Called Dr. again Dec19 with continued pain and decreasing mobility with increasing pain intensity. Got in to Dr.'s office and saw his nurse-practitioner on Jan22. Their office had multiple people look online at pharmaceutical sites regarding vaccine reactions and found that reactions were only to have lasted a week. As I was continuing to feel worse as time passed since the shot, and they really didn't know what to do, so I was prescribed Prednisone at the rate of 20mg for eighteen days. The prednisone ran out Feb13. Pain and joint stiffness intensified and by Feb17 I could not get out of bed. It took me two and a half hours to get out of bed, then I had to get changed and I was able to take myself to the Emergency Room where I was assisted into the building. At emergency I spoke with three doctors over an eight hour span. Tests included blood work and xrays after having shared my story since having the shot. They advised to stop Crestor as that can cause joint aches  I was to stop it for two weeks. I was put on a 10mg Prednisone twelve day taper-pack (60-40-30-20-10), which I finished Mar1. High dose of prednisone dose at the beginning was causing me to have jitters, heart palpitations and not sleeping. As the Prednisone tapered down, aches returned. So on Mar18 I started my CRESTOR again as pains were returning in spite of not taking it. No relief from muscle and joint aches was ever fully received. Later in March I had many more blood tests and Apr4 I was sent to a Rheumatologist and had many appointments where more blood work and prednisone given, without any relief. I saw Dr. May 1. On this date he had decided that what I had was something called Polymyalgia Rhumatica for the lack of knowing what else to call my situation. Needless to say, I was angry and upset to think that all these months knowing that this pneumonia shot did this to me and that the DRs. wouldn't even think about this having been caused by the pneumonia shot. I had to sell my home because I couldn't care for myself. Now in appointments have continued to this day. Other DRs. have encouraged me to report this because I am not the only one who has had had severe reactions from having vaccine shots.

On unknown date, at age 3 years 3 months, the patient went to the emergency department because of lower back pain and a new rash of 3 days duration. The rash consisted of around 25 vesicles located to the left of the spine along dermatomes L4-S1, with a few vesicles on the left leg. He complained of pain and itchiness at the rash site and was reluctant to walk in the emergency department. He had experienced no changes in bowel or bladder function. After admission, a neurologic examination revealed no deficits, but did reveal allodynia to light touch in the distribution of rash. He had full strength in all limbs, no apparent sensory deficits and normal muscle stretch reflexes. Because a screening polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of the rash was positive for varicella zoster virus (VZV) and the patient was diagnosed with herpes zoster (shingles). The patient was treated with acyclovir suspension for 10 days. His rash and other symptoms slowly resolved with no further complaints on an unknown date. The author considered the events to be related to the suspect therapy. The child had never had wild-type varicella nor had he been exposed to family members with herpes zoster. In follow-up, the child developed signs of asthma, but no evidence of autoimmune diseases or neuralgia. The author stated in some immunized children, virus reactivates within a few months to a few years to cause the dermatomal exanthem known as herpes zoster (shingles).

Considering implausible temporal relationship and the infective origin of the event chorioamnionitis, the causal role of study vaccine is ruled out. Hence, the causality of the event assessed as not related. The event previable rupture of membrane can be explained by the underlying chorioamnionitis and the event anhydramnios and spontaneous abortion are the consequences of the underlying events. Hence, causality assessed as not related to these events. The decision to administer a vaccine during pregnancy is related to medical decision made by the mother and her physician and is not related to any property of the medication.

The patient was diagnosed with streptococcal test positive, 1 month 19 days post vaccination and ultrasound abdomen detected oligohydramnios, more than 2 months post vaccination which progressed over a week to severe oligohydramnios requiring induction of labor. The company assessed the causality of the event nausea with the study vaccine as unassessable due to the lack of information regarding the onset latency of the event. The event streptococcal test positive causality assessed as not related considering the bacterial aetiology. The event oligohydramnios lacks known biological evidence associated with the vaccine. Hence, assessed as not related to study vaccine. Advanced maternal age and multigravida are considered as known risk factors for oligohydramnios.

Due to the lack of information important for the causality assessment, such as onset latency between the vaccination and reported event of echogenic cardiac foci and details regarding the event, company assessed the causality as unassessable. Considering an implausible temporal relationship between the event of umbilical cord around neck and the vaccination, lack of evidence for a biological mechanism that could cause the event and incidental nature of the event, the sponsor assessed the event as not related to study vaccine. The decision to administer a vaccine during pregnancy is related to medical decision making by the mother and her physician and is not related to any property of the medication.

Initial laboratory workup showed elevated protein in cerebrospinal fluid and no evidence of infection. anti-nuclear,-VGCC,-MUSK and-GQ1b antibodies were negative. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids for possible Guillain-Barre Syndrome, however his condition deteriorated, and the patient developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, complete quadriplegia, nystagmus, and multilobar pneumonia. Electromyography (EMG) demonstrated a severe diffuse demyelinating pattern. On day 16, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed innumerable foci of T2 flair hyperintensity involving brain and spinal cord. On day 17 of hospitalisation, the patient died and permission for autopsy was granted. Neuropathologic examination showed multiple soft lesions with tan discoloration throughout the brain and spinal cord, predominantly involving periventricular white matter, bilateral basal ganglia, corpus callosum, cerebellar white matter, pons, medulla and upper cervical spinal cord. Microscopic examination showed discrete areas of demyelination surrounding vessels, with patchy macrophage aggregation, sparse CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration and mild reactive gliosis at the periphery. In a few of the lesions, the infiltrate was composed of neutrophils. Inflammation when present was perivascular or in the brain parenchyma and did not involve the vessel wall. No haemorrhage or viral inclusions were identified. Luxol fast blue stain demonstrated loss of myelin within the lesions. Neurofilament immunohistochemical stain highlighted relative preservation of axons, although spheroids and axonal disruption were also present. The findings were most consistent with the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a patient with HIV infection and recent influenza vaccination. This case has been considered serious due to death/hospitalisation. The authors stated, ""ADEM presentation in patients with HIV may be atypical and should be considered with acute rapid worsening of weakness, especially in temporal relationship to vaccination"".

The patient's mother was 38-year-old female, who had no previous pregnancies. The mother had no family history of offspring and no relevant maternal and paternal medical history. The mother did not use tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs during pregnancy. The mother's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 10-Apr-2018. The type of pregnancy was singleton. It was reported that the at an age of 38 years the mother had pregnancy which considered as advanced maternal age. The patient's mother underwent prenatal birth weight (PNBW) test (on 25-Jun-2018), non-invasive prenatal (NIPT) testing (on 10-Jul-2018), and anatomical scan (on 10-Sep-2018) which showed no congenital malformations. On 18-Oct-2018, 1-hour glucola test (as reported) was performed which showed elevated. On 23-Oct-2018, at gestation age of 28 weeks, the fetus was exposed to AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT [influenza vaccine, batch number: YF41708, route of administration: transplacental, dose, anatomical location, and expiry date: not reported] (explicitly coded as foetal exposure during pregnancy) for an unknown indication. On the same day, 3-hour glucola test (as reported) was performed and no congenital malformation was noted. On 21-Dec-2018, patient underwent Group B streptococcus (GBS) culture test which was negative, and no congenital malformations were noted. 2 months and 19 days after vaccination, the mother delivered a full-term female neonate at 39.4 weeks gestation. Pregnancy complications were reported as meconium and fetal intolerance of labor. The delivery method was reported as forceps. The neonate's birth weight was 3858 grams, head circumference was 34.5 cm and body length was 53.3 cm. The APGAR scores were 7 (one minute) and 9 (five minutes). APGAR score was not reported for 10 minutes. There was no major congenital malformation was noted. The outcome of the events was not reported. The mother's estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 15-Jan-2019. This case is linked to 201805302, the corresponding maternal pregnancy report.; Reporter's Comments: A male neonate patient was born with fetal intolerance of labor (fetal distress) and meconium in amniotic fluid, more than 2 months after maternal receipt of AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT vaccine at 28 weeks of gestation (considered as fetal exposure during pregnancy). Considering implausible temporal relationship and biological implausibility, the event fetal distress during labor assessed as not related. The event meconium in amniotic cavity can be alternatively explained by fetal distress rather than suspect vaccine. Hence, causality assessed as not related. The decision to administer a vaccine during pregnancy is related to medical decision made by the mother and her physician and is not related to any property of the medication. Hence, the event fetal exposure during pregnancy assessed as not related considering the intended use of the vaccine. The company assessed the events 'fetal intolerance of labor and meconium in amniotic fluid' as serious (medically significant).",,,,,,,,,U,10/23/2018,,,,UNK,,,,,,USSEQIRUS201901229,2,02/12/2019,,,,

I did review my medical records for the x-rays that were taken on 12/11/18 which noted no abnormalities as it related especially to any arthritic conditions or shoulder injuries which did not surprise me. I did attend four  hour sessions of Physical Therapy with as ordered on my December 11th appointment. My progress as far as this type of intervention with physical therapy I believed occurred because my body was fighting back against what felt like an attack on my joints of course mostly on the left hand side of my body. I believe initial report will indicate some loss of motion and weakness of left arm movement and swelling of the left knee. During the PT sessions I did perform some limited exercise but was stressed that I use cold compresses to ease the pain and inflammation.  I used both heat and cold compresses which did start delivering some relief. I also continue to use Tylenol for the pain along with the Celecoxib for inflammation. If you remember, I was given the Celecoxib because of my constant pain in my left chest by my breast area along with pain in my left jaw area during my wellness exam in September 2018. That is also when I received my flu and pneumonia shot both in the left shoulder. I have some real concerns that my illness was caused by the flu and or pneumonia vaccination that I received in September. I did not have an immediate reaction to the vaccinations other than a really sore left shoulder with pain that still lingers in the location of the vaccination. However, within two weeks of the vaccination I noticed I could not raise my left knee and thought that this was unusual but would just go away so I worked around it. There was no pain associated with the loss of movement of my left leg at this time. I could walk and managed steps carefully but I just could not raise my left leg any high. I can only associate it with my brain trying to tell my leg to raise but my leg not responding. I have no problems with raising my right leg. However, a few weeks later I was in a full blown crisis with pain in my left shoulder and left leg. I also then experienced a problem with the use of my left arm not being able to move it without assistance. If I was asked what the pain level was I would put it at a 10 or above. I would get the chills and took hot baths to obtain some relief. I could not sleep on my left side and if I wanted to roll from my back  to my right side I did this only by lifting my left leg and arm with my right arm. With the use of the medication and time I can honestly state that gradually I have regained the use of my left arm but not the full motion of my left leg. I still have pain for both my left shoulder and left knee but it is greatly reduced as long as I take the Celecoxib and Tylenol. During the worse episodes I experienced shooting pains in intervals on both my left shoulder and left leg. These shooting pains still occur but not at the level as I experienced in October ? December. Currently my left shoulder feels like I was punched in the arm but I now have regained  motion but still get small shooting pains in intervals. It is my left leg that I am most concerned about. I still do not have full motion, meaning I cannot actively just lift my left knee up. I can walk and take steps very carefully. However, I do not dare try to run and I am really afraid of falling because the knee is so tender. I also get those funny shooting pains in my left knee. During the month of December while in physical therapy I noticed that first my left elbow then my right elbow was sore. Believe me I have not done anything that should have caused any injury to either elbows because I have been babying my left shoulder and left knee. Now my left elbow is slightly swollen and I am retaining some fluid. I have just started feeling slight shooting pains in my left elbow. Is there any other medical treatment or test that can be conducted i.e. MRI, or other blood test?

He was seen by his doctor 6 days after immunization and found to have bilateral hand weakness on exam, referred to Local Neurologist for evaluation and brain/c-spine MRIs, labs obtained. Local Neurologist reviewed MRIs (brain MRI on 12/5/2017 showed ""numerous scattered white matter subcortical increased T2/flair signal densities within the predominantly frontal lobe and to lesser extent the upper frontal parietal junction regions"" and C-spine MRI on 12/12/2017 showed ""mild degenerative changes at C4-C5 and C5-C6 that efface the ventral CSF space and narrows the central canal."" Nerve conduction study/EMG on 12/8/2017 showed ""changes in left deltoid and bicep muscles that are nonspecific but may represent residual changes from a previous left cervical (C5, C6) radiculopathy given the absence of active denervation. Rest of study is unremarkable."" There was concern by the Neurologist about possible Parsonage-Turner syndrome (brachial neuritis) or neuralgic amyotrophy - he ordered a brachial plexus MRI (done 12/21/2017 and was wnl) and repeat brain MRI with contrast. Generalized symptoms resolved and arm symptoms became isolated to the left arm only. Patient continued to complain of left arm weakness and pain. He was treated with an oral steroid burst (12/14/2017), sent to Physical Therapy. He had mild improvement in symptoms but symptoms persisted. A 2nd EMG was done on 1/17/2018 which showed ""mild neurogenic changes without active denervation at the left biceps and deltoid muscles that are nonspecific but may be related to residual changes from a previous cervical (C6) radiculopathy."" Gabapentin was ordered. Patient also had CSF studies done on 2/2/2018, only report from those studies is that no malignant cells were found. Patient was eventually seen at a tertiary center (on 9/17/2018 ) where patient reported that his original symptoms included weakness of left arm with numbness/tingling, decreased feeling in his fingers. He reported improvement in overall symptoms but still 40% decrease in his usual strength. On exam their note states his 'motor strength in the left upper extremity was 4/5, and sensory exam showed hyperesthesia and decrease in cold sensation in the left upper extremity.' The neurologist's impression was that patient had: ""signs and symptoms consistent with left brachial neuritis, probably related to vaccine. Recommended to continue PT. IVIG is an option that may expedite recovery. For pain suggested LYRICA, CYMBALTA or ELAVIL."" They ordered various labs and wanted to repeat his brain/c-spine and brachial plexus MRIs before proceeding with IVIG treatment. The repeat MRIs did not show any new findings, his repeat EMG done on 10/8/2018 states 'there is electrodiagnostic evidence of left mild and chronic C6/C7/C8 radiculopathy without ongoing denervation.' Patient did also see a neurosurgeon on 10/2/108 whose note states that his cervical spine did not appear to be producing his numbness and tingling that were occurring in his left upper arm. He received IVIG Jan 13-18, 2019 and started to have hot/cold flashes and burning sensation in his left shoulder radiating down the arm.
